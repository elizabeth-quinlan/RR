% script RR_Repeat_Symbol_Test
% Demonstrates the use of the Repeat Symbol Test as
% one (of several!) statistical tests to confirm the "randomness"
% of a sequence of random integers x between a=1 and b.
% This test plots the histogram of minimum j>0 for which x_i=x_(i+j),
% normalized to reflect the corresponding pdf, and compares to the
% exponential distribution of this result that is predicted by theory.
