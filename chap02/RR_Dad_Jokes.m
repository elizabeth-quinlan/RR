function RR_Dad_Jokes(i_max)
% Modifies a random sequence of integers generated by Matlab's randi command to
% eliminate integers that appear as the n+1=8 most recent integers in the sequence.
% Each integer corresponds to a "joke" in a "dictionary".
% TEST: RR_Dad_Jokes      % tells one joke drawn randomly from the dictionary
%       RR_Dad_Jokes(64)  % tells 64 jokes, without recent repeats
% TODO: replace the "jokes" below with jokes that are actually funny.
%       (left as an exercise by the discerning reader...)
