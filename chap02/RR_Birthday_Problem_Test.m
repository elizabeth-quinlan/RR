% script RR_Birthday_Problem_Test
% Demonstrates the use of the Birthday Problem (the likelihood that at least 2
% of n people have the same birthday, as a function of n) as one (of several!)
% statistical tests to confirm the "randomness" of a sequence of random integers.
% This test plots the histogram of minimum number of people in several random
% groupings for 2 people to have the same birthday, and compares to the
% distribution (as a CDF) of this result that is predicted by theory.
